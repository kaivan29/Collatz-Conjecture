Collatz Conjecture

Given a starting integer n, less than one million, a sequence (which terminates at 1) can be generated using the following criteria;
1.	If n is even, n = n/2
2.	If n is odd, n = 3n + 1
As an example, if we start with n = 13, the sequence generated would be;
{13, 40, 20, 10, 5, 16, 8, 4, 2 1}
Task: Find the starting integer n which produces the longest sequence.
